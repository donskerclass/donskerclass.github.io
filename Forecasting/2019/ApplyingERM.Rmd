## Empirical Risk Minimization

- Empirical Risk Minimizer
$$\widehat{f}^{ERM}(\mathcal{Y}_T)=\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\arg\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\ell(y_{t+h},f(\mathcal{Y}_t))$$
- Saw in previous classes that empirical risk minimization can do a good job
    - **Most of the time**, loss is small **on average** with respect to "true" distribution, **relative** to **empirical risk** or **oracle risk**
    - If true distribution $p\in\mathcal{P}$ is **stationary** and **weak dependent** and hypothesis class $\mathcal{F}$ is **low complexity**
- Today
    - Examples of useful hypothesis classes
    - Handling (some) cases of nonstationarity, strong dependence
    
    
## Linear Function Classes

- Let $\mathcal{Z}_T=\{z_t\}_{t=1}^{T}$, $z_t\in\mathbb{R}^d$ be some set of "predictor variables"
- $z_t$ may include 
    - Lagged values of series to be forecast $\{y_{t-k}\}_{k=0}^{p}$
    - A constant term $1$
    - Other variables known at time $t$
$$\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z})=\{f(z)=\sum_{j=1}^dz_j\beta_j:\ \beta\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\}$$
- Most commonly used function class by far in all areas of data analysis
- ERM with linear class goes by many different names
    - Square Loss: Ordinary Least Squares Regression
    - Absolute Loss: Least Absolute Deviations Regression
    - Categorical Cross-Entropy Loss: Logistic Regression


## Predictors

- Role of predictors $z_t$ is to provide information about $y_{t+h}$
- Want $\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z})$ such that oracle risk $\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z})}{\min}R_p(f)$ is small
    - Choose variables such that $\sum_{j=1}^d\beta_jz_{jt}$ provides good description of $y_{t+h}$
    - Use intuition, economic theory, and availability of measurements to find predictors
- Past values of $y_t$ (almost) always available and often closely associated
- Economically relevant variables depend on context
    - Often $y_t$ related to other variables by accounting identity, e.g. $y_t=z_{1t}+z_{2t}$ by definition
- Note that we need to predict $y_{t+h}$ using $z_t$, not $z_{t+h}$
    - Can use past but not contemporaneous values, so knowing $y_t$ depends on $z_t$ not enough
    - Can help to use multiple lags of $z_t$
- Also want class such that generalization error is small
    - Depends on sample size, model complexity, and dependence
        - If sample small or strongly dependent, use simpler class
        - All predictors need to satisfy stationarity and weak dependence: not just $y_t$
    - Best class for ERM usually **not** class minimizing oracle risk
    
<!-- - Unless $z_{t+h}$ known in advance (or can be forecasted accurately!)  -->    
    
## Nonlinear predictors

- Using a linear function class does not require linear relationship between variables
- Can include nonlinear transformations of variables $z_t$ as predictors 
$$\Phi(z_t)=\{\phi_j(z_t)\}_{j=1}^J$$
- Class becomes $\mathcal{F}(\Phi(\mathbf{Z}))=\sum_{j=1}^{J}\beta_j\phi_j(z_t)$
- Examples:
    - Polynomials: $\phi_j(z)=z^{j-1}$
    - Multivariate polynomials: $\phi_{j}(z)=z_1^{j_1}\cdot z_2^{j_2}\cdot\ldots z_d^{j_d}$
    - Piecewise polynomials (splines): $\phi_{jk}(z)=z^k1\{t_{j-1}<z<t_{j}\}$
    - Trigonometric functions (Fourier): $\phi_{j}(z)=cos(\pi jz)$
    - Etc: Anything else you can think of!
- Extremely general relationships can be modeled this way
- Model complexity can blow up if many nonlinear terms used
    - In multivariate case, # of parameters exponential in $d$
    - Run into overfitting problems very quickly: can do very badly in practice

## Linear regression

- Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression solves ERM for square loss and linear function class
$$\widehat{\beta}=\underset{\beta\in\mathbb{R}^d}{\arg\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T-h}(y_{t+h}-\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j)^2$$
- Implementation: minimizer has known formula
    - For case where predictors are past values, have `Arima`,`arima`, `Ar` commands
    - For general predictors $z_t$, use `lm` (or `tslm` or `dynlm` when working with lags)

```{r, eval=FALSE, class.source='fold-show'}
#Select coefficients (b0,b1,b2,b3) by minimizing square loss
regression<-lm(y~z1+z2+z3)
#Produce forecasts by evaluating regression function at latest values
regressionforecast<-forecast(regression,zt)
#AR(2) forecast
autoregression<-dynlm(y~L(y,1)+L(y,2)) 
autoregressionforecast<-predict(autoregression,zt)
```

## Application: GDP Growth Forecasting

- The US Bureau of Economic Analysis collects aggregate economic data in the National Income and Product Accounts
- Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is measure of the market value of total output in the US economy
    - Used as a measure of aggregate economic activity in all areas
    - Forecasts used by policymakers and businesses to plan for level of expenditures
- Composed, by definition, of sum of Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports 
    - Y = C + I + G + NX   
- Predict quarterly log changes using lagged change and lags of changes in components (exclude one for redundancy)
$$\underset{\beta\in\mathbb{R}^5}{\min}\frac{1}{T-1}\sum_{t=1}^{T-1}(\Delta Y_{t+1}-(\beta_0+\beta_1\Delta Y_{t}+\beta_2\Delta C_{t}+\beta_3\Delta I_{t}+\beta_4\Delta G_{t}))^2$$

## Loss Guarantees for OLS

- Bayes forecast for square loss is (conditional) expectation $m^*(\mathcal{Z}_T):=E_p[y_{t+h}|\mathcal{Z}_T]$
- Oracle forecast rule solves $\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z})}{\min}E_p[(m^*(\mathcal{Z}_T)-f(\mathcal{Z}_T))^2]$
    - OLS approximates conditional mean: oracle risk smallest when $\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z})$ contains this 
- For any $p\in\mathcal{P}$ such that $(y_{t+h},z_t)$ stationary and mixing with finite variance
    - Probability that excess risk relative to oracle exceeds any fixed constant $c$ goes to 0 as $T\to\infty$
    - p(($\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T-h}(y_{t+h}-\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\widehat{\beta}^{\text{OLS}}_j)^2-\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}E_p[(y_{t+h}-\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j)^2])>c)\overset{T\to\infty}{\to}0$
- Above conditions do not say anything about finite $T$ excess risk
    - No uniform bounds
    - "Its performance is... typically poor in most applications" (Mohri et al 2012, p246)
    - Problem is that $\mathcal{F}$ unbounded: predictions could be anywhere
- Simplicity, interpretability, ease of use make it popular method

## Least Absolute Deviations regression

- LAD regression solves ERM for absolute (MAE) loss and linear function class
$$\widehat{\beta}=\underset{\beta\in\mathbb{R}^d}{\arg\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T-h}\left|y_{t+h}-\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j\right|$$
- Absolute Error weights small forecast errors more and large forecast errors less than square loss
    - Predictions tolerate more large errors but do better with typical case
- Can show (won't prove) that best predictor is the (conditional) **median** of $y$ given $z$
    - P(y<=median(y|z)|z)=P(y>=median(y|z)|z)=0.5
    - Searches for a value so you are as likely to be wrong above as below
- Implementation: minimizer computable by fast algorithm as a special case of quantile regression
    - Use `rq` command in library `quantreg`
```{r,class.source='fold-show'}
#Select coefficients (b0,b1,b2,b3,b4) by minimizing absolute loss
gdpLAD<-rq(dgdp~ldgdp+ldpcec+ldinvest+ldgce)
#Produce forecasts by evaluating regression function at latest values
gdp2018Q4fcstLAD<-predict(gdpLAD,zt)
```

## Application: Comparison of LAD and OLS Forecasts

- Forecasts of log GDP growth in 2018Q4
    - OLS: `r gdp2018Q4fcstOLS`
    - LAD: `r gdp2018Q4fcstLAD`,  

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

#Table of results
payemerrors<-data.frame(Coefficient=c("Constant",
                  "Delta log(Y_{t-1})","Delta log(C_{t-1})","Delta log(I_{t-1})",
                  "Delta log(G_{t-1})"),
  OLScoeffs=gdpOLS$coefficients,
  LADcoeffs=gdpLAD$coefficients)
kable(payemerrors,
  col.names=c("Coefficient","OLS",
              "LAD"),
  caption="Coefficients for ERM in GDP Growth Forecast")
```
- Predictions are fairly similar, but not the same
    - Weight different events differently
    - Bigger differences can occur if median far from mean

## Binary Prediction

- $y_t$ a binary (0,1) variable: 1 if something happened, 0 if it didn't
    - Recession or no recession, default or no default, buy or don't buy
- Could use loss function which is small if prediction right, large if wrong
    - 0-1 Loss: $0$ if $\widehat{y}_t=y_t$, $1$ if $\widehat{y}_t\neq y_t$
    - Useful if forecast must be a **classifier**: make binary decision based on outcome
- Alternately: allow forecasts $\widehat{y}\in[0,1]$ and use loss based on closeness to $y$
    - Useful if goal is to learn probability of outcome 
- **Categorical cross-entropy loss** $\ell(y,\widehat{y})=y\log(\widehat{y})+(1-y)\log(1-\widehat{y})$
    - 0 if $\widehat{y}=y$, $\infty$ if $\widehat{y}=1-y$
    - $E_p[\ell(y,\widehat{y})]$ minimized at $\widehat{y}=p(y=1)$
- **Brier score** is name given to square loss for binary prediction
    - $E_p[(y-\widehat{y})^2]$ also minimized at $\widehat{y}=p(y=1)$  
- Can turn $\widehat{y}\in[0,1]$ to classifier $\in\{0,1\}$  by thresholding
    - Predict $1\{\widehat{y}>c\}$, usually for $c=0.5$


## Logistic Regression

- To make prediction in $[0,1]$, apply monotone transformation $F:\ \mathbb{R}\to[0,1]$ to linear predictor class 
    - Typical choice: **Logistic** (or **softmax**) function $F(x)=\frac{\exp(x)}{1+\exp(x)}$
    - Apply ERM to loss $y\log(F(f))+(1-y)\log(1-F(f))$
- **Logistic regression** solves ERM for cross-entropy loss and softmax applied to linear function class 
$$\widehat{\beta}=\underset{\beta\in\mathbb{R}^d}{\arg\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T-h}(y_{t+h}\log(F(\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j))+(1-y_{t+h})\log(1-F(\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j)))$$
- Implementation: minimizer computable by fast algorithm
    - Use `glm` command with option `family=binomial(link="logit")`
```{r, eval=FALSE,class.source='fold-show'}
#Select coefficients (b0,b1,b2,b3) by minimizing categorical cross-entropy loss
logitregression<-glm(y~z1+z2+z3,family=binomial(link="logit"))
#Produce forecasts by evaluating regression function at latest values
logitregressionforecast<-predict(logitregression,zt,type="response")
```    

<!-- ## Linear regression Properties -->

<!-- - Previously justified ERM based on small generalization or oracle risk -->
<!-- - What does this look like for square loss -->
<!-- $$R_p(\mathcal{F})=E_p[(y_{t+h}-f(z_t))^2]=E_p[E_p[(y_{t+h}-f(z_t))^2|z_t]]$$ -->
<!-- $$=E_p[E_p[(y^2_{t+h}-2y_{t+h}f(z_t)+f^2(z_t)|z_t]]$$ -->
<!-- $$=E_p[y^2_{t+h}-2E_p[y_{t+h}|z_t]f(z_t)+f^2(z_t)]$$ -->
<!-- $$\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}E_p[y^2_{t+h}-2E_p[y_{t+h}|z_t]f(z_t)+f^2(z_t)]=\underset{f(z)}{\min}$$ -->


<!-- ## OLS approximation -->
<!-- - What does this look like for linear regression -->
<!-- $$R^*_p(\mathcal{F})=\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}E_p[(y_{t+h}-\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j)^2]$$ -->
<!-- $$\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\arg\min}E_p[y^{2}_{t+h}-2y_{t+h}(\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j)+(\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j)^2]$$ -->
<!-- - Take first order conditions with respect to $\beta_k$ -->
<!-- $$E_p[y_{t+h}z_{kt}]=E_p[z_{kt}\sum_{j=1}^dz_{jt}\beta_j]$$ -->

## Application: Recession Forecasting

- A recession is a period of sustained economic contraction
    - Characterized informally as "a sequence of two or more quarters of negative output growth"
- Official dates are declared by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee
    - Monthly $(0,1)$ variable going back to 1854
- Use logistic regression with 2 lags of past indicator as predictors
```{r}
#The NBER recession indicator has FRED ID "USREC"
#1 in NBER declared recession, 0 in any other date
USREC<-fredr(series_id = "USREC")
usrec<-ts(USREC$value,frequency=12,start=c(1854,12)) #Convert to time series
#Produce lagged values
l1usrec<-window(lag(usrec,-1),start=c(1855,2),end=c(2019,1))
l2usrec<-window(lag(usrec,-2),start=c(1855,2),end=c(2019,1))
recession<-window(usrec,start=c(1855,2),end=c(2019,1))
```
```{r}
recessionlogit<-glm(recession~l1usrec+l2usrec,family=binomial(link="logit"))
```
```{r}
recessionlogit$coefficients
```
- Coefficients go into softmax function to produce a probability of recession
    - Being in a recession this month predicts higher chance next month
    - But being in a recession two months ago predicts lower chance

## Recessions, Predicted and Observed

```{r}
probs<-predict(recessionlogit,type="response")
recessionprobs<-ts(probs,frequency=12,start=c(1855,2))
autoplot(usrec,series="NBER Recession Indicator")+
  autolayer(recessionprobs,series="Predicted Probability of Recession")+
  ggtitle("NBER Recessions and Logit Autoregression Forecasted Probabilities") +
   ylab("Probability of Recession")+xlab("Date")+
   guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Series"))
```

## What if my data isn't stationary or weak dependent?

- Principle of ERM relies on assumptions
    - Future data will be like past data
    - Sample averages are good approximation of future averages
- There are infinite ways this can be violated
    - Nothing says that data that looks "well behaved" now will continue to be so in the future
    - If this is a major concern, there is little the statistical approach can offer
    - Online learning approach (much later) can help, but only by changing objective
- Often, we face slightly simpler problems
    - Stationarity or weak dependence fail, but in detectable and correctable ways
    - At least for these, important to check and perform the needed corrections

    
## Nonstationary probability models

- A probability model $p$ is nonstationary if $p(y_{t})\neq p(y_{s})$
    - Distribution $p_t(y_t)$ depends on time $t$
- Goal becomes to find rule $f_{t}$ to achieve small **time-dependent risk** 
$$R_{p_{T+h}}(f):=E_{p_{T+h}}\ell(y_{T+h},f_{T}(\mathcal{Y}_T))$$    
- One model of nonstationarity: **additive components model**
    - $y_t=\tilde{y}_t+T(t)$, $\tilde{y}_t\sim\tilde{p}(.)$ stationary and weak dependent, $T(t)$ a deterministic function of time
- If $\log(y_t)$ is additive components model, call it multiplicative components model     
- Examples    
    - Linear Trend: $T(t)=ct$ for a constant $c$
    - Deterministic Seasonality: $T(t)=\sum_{j=1}^{k}a_j1\{t\mod k=j\}$ (eg, add $a_j$ in month $j$)
    - Structural breaks: $T(t)=c\cdot 1\{T\geq k\}$ for constant c, break date $k$
    - Outliers: $T(t)=c1\{T=k\}$ add c at date $k$
    - Smooth Trend: $T(t)$ is an arbitrary "smooth" (eg 2x differentiable) function
    

## Restoring stationarity

- If way that distribution depends on time is **known**, can use this to make predictions
- One possible solution: find invertible transform $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_t=T(\mathcal{Y}_t,t)$ so that $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_t$ is stationary
- In additive components model, just subtract nonstationary part $T(t)$
    - $\tilde{y}_t=y_t-T(t)$ is stationary and weak dependent
- Goes by different names depending on form of nonstationarity
    - Detrending, deseasonalizing, break removal    
- Other models may require other transformations
- Differencing: $\Delta y_t=y_{t}-y_{t-1}$
    - Turns linear trends into constant $Delta(ct)=c$, random walk $y_{t}=y_{t-1}+e_{t}$ into $e_t$, stationary series 
- Double (triple, etc) differencing   $\Delta^{k}y_t=\Delta\Delta\ldots\Delta{y}_t$
    - Removes linear and quadratic (cubic, etc) trends
    - If difference of series is a random walk, double difference is stationary
- Seasonal differencing: $y_{t}-y_{t-k}$
    - Removes additive seasonality at frequency $k$


## Applying ERM with detrending

- Detrended ERM Procedure
    1. Detrend data $\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_T=\{\tilde{y}_t\}_{t=1}^{T}$
    2. Apply ERM to detrended data $\widehat{f}^{ERM}(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_T)=\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\arg\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\ell(\tilde{y}_{t+h},f(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_t))$
    3. Add trend back to make prediction $\widehat{y}_{T+h}=\widehat{f}^{ERM}(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_T)+T(T+h)$
- Suppose loss function depends only on distance $\ell(x,y)=\ell(x-y,0)$
    - True for square loss, absolute loss, etc
- Then $E_{p_{T+h}}\ell(y_{T+h},\widehat{y}_{T+h})$ $=E_{p}\ell(y_{T+h}-T(T+h),\widehat{f}^{ERM}(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_T))$ $=E_{p}\ell(\tilde{y}_{T+h},\widehat{f}^{ERM}(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_T))$
- Result: risk guarantees for $y_t$ are same as those for $\tilde{y}_t$, which satisfies usual ERM conditions 
 
## What if source of nonstationarity not known?

- In some cases, theory or prior knowledge tells you about trend
    - Stock variables likely to contain linear trends or random walk behavior
    - Efficient Market Hypothesis: Prices in financial markets are random walks
    - Solution: forecast differences instead of levels!
    - Add differences back to get levels if needed
- In other cases, some parameters $\theta$ of trend $T(t,\theta)$ not known
    - Slope $c$ of linear trend $ct$, size $a_j$ of month/quarter seasonal effects,etc
- Posssible solution: estimate $T(t,\theta)$ by procedure $T(.,\widehat{\theta})$ using data
- Method 1: detrend then apply ERM
    1. Estimate trend $\widehat{\theta}=\underset{\theta}{\arg\min}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\ell(y_t,T(t,\theta))$
    2. Run ERM on approximate detrended data $\widehat{f}^{ERM}(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_T)=\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\arg\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\ell(y_{t+h}-T(.,\widehat{\theta}),f(\mathcal{Y}_t-T(.,\widehat{\theta})))$
- Method 2: Apply ERM including trend
    1. $(\widehat{f}^{ERM}(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}_T),\widehat{\theta})=\underset{(f\in\mathcal{F},\theta)}{\arg\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\ell(y_{t+h},f(\mathcal{Y}_t)+T(.,\theta))$
   
   
## Implementation

- Joint procedure extremely easy to implement for linear model class
    - Just add $T(.,\theta)$ to regression equation
- Commands `dynlm`, `tslm` can include linear trend, seasonality, etc in ordinary least squares formula    
```{r,eval=FALSE,class.source='fold-show'}
#OLS with prediction rule b_0+b1*z1_t+b2*y_{t-1}+c*t+sum(a_j*season_j)
regression<-dynlm(y~z1+L(y)+trend(y)+season(y))
```
- Or just create variables and include in prediction equation


## When does this method work?

- For ERM under usual conditions, do **not** have to assume that model $\mathcal{F}$ is "correct"
    - Here "correct" means $\mathcal{F}$ contains the Bayes forecast rule
    - Still approach best risk in class $\mathcal{F}$
- In nonstationary case **do** need transformation $T(t)$ to be the correct one
    - If $T(t)$ known exactly $\tilde{y}_t=y_t-T(t)$ is stationary
    - If $\widehat{T}(t)$ is approximated, $\widehat{\tilde{y}}_t=y_t-\widehat{T}(t)$ is not stationary
- ERM applied with approximate detrending does not have same guarantees
    - Most straightforward problem: error from $\widehat{T}(T+h)-T(t+h)$ added
    - Harder problem: if stationarity not exact, chosen $f$ may be affected
- Hard to show general results, but in many cases, additional approximation error is small
    - Linear (or polynomial) trends and seasonality known to have small effect on error of OLS
    - Bonus slides give some sufficient conditions on $\ell$, $\mathcal{F}$, $\widehat{T}(.)$ for small error
- In other cases additional approximation error known to be a big problem
    - Especially for smooth trends (cf Hamilton 2018)


## Conclusions

- ERM with linear hypotheses provides simple and interpretable forecasting tool
    - Can accomodate past values, external predictors, and nonlinearities
- Performance usually okay with larger samples
    - If data stationary and model not too complicated
- Transforming, deseasonalizing, detrending, etc can be used to get back to stationarity
- If nonstationaity takes additive form, this can be added as variable in linear predictor

## Bonus Slide: Risk From Approximate Detrending

- Consider additive components model $y_t=\tilde{y}_t+T(t)$
- Assume $\widehat{T}(.)$ converges to $T(t)$ with high probability in $p$
    - w.p. $1-\delta$, $\underset{t\in1\ldots T+h}{\max}\left|\widehat{T}(t)-T(t)\right|\leq b(\delta,T)\overset{T\to\infty}{\to}0$ 
    - Use some method to get uniformly accurate trend estimates
- Let $\ell(y,\widehat{y})=\ell(y-\widehat{y},0)$ be $L_1$-Lipschitz
    - $\left|\ell(x+a,0)-\ell(x,0)\right|\leq L_1\left|a\right|$ for all $x,a$
    - Permits absolute loss but not square loss
- Let all $f\in\mathcal{F}$ be $L_2$ Lipschitz in all $d$ arguments
    - Permits linear predictors if coefficients bounded
- Want to bound excess risk of post-detrending predictor relative to oracle with known $T(t)$ and distribution $p$
$$\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T-h}\ell(y_{t+h},f(\{y_s-\widehat{T}(s)\}_{s=1}^{t})+\widehat{T}(t+h))-\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}E_{p}[\ell(y_{T+h},f(y_{t+h},f(\{y_s-T(s)\}_{s=1}^{T})+T(T+h))]$$

## Bonus Slide 2: Proof of Bound

- Consider approximate detrended empirical risk minus exactly detrended empirical risk
$$\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T-h}\ell(y_{t+h},f(\{y_s-\widehat{T}(s)\}_{s=1}^{t})+\widehat{T}(t+h))-\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T-h}\ell(y_{t+h},f(\{y_s-T(s)\}_{s=1}^{t})-T(t+h))$$
- Difference in min bounded by max of difference 
$$\leq \underset{f\in\mathcal{F},t\in1\ldots T}{\sup}\left|\ell(y_{t+h},f(\{y_s-\widehat{T}(s)\}_{s=1}^{t})+\widehat{T}(t+h)-\ell(y_{t+h},f(\{y_s-T(s)\}_{s=1}^{t})+T(t+h)\right|$$
- By Lipschitz conditions bound by $\leq dL_1L_2\underset{t\in1\ldots T+h}{\max}\left|\widehat{T}(t)-T(t)\right|$
- Add and subtract exactly detrended empirical risk to bound excess risk by $dL_1L_2\underset{t\in1\ldots T+h}{\max}\left|\widehat{T}(t)-T(t)\right|+$
$$(\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}\frac{1}{T-h}\sum_{t=1}^{T-h}\ell(y_{t+h},f(\{y_s-T(s)\}_{s=1}^{t})+T(t+h))-\underset{f\in\mathcal{F}}{\min}E_{p}[\ell(y_{T+h},f(y_{t+h},f(\{y_s-T(s)\}_{s=1}^{T})+T(T+h))])$$
- Last term is excess risk or ERM for exactly detrended data
    - Bounded with high probability by standard ERM inequality under usual assumptions 
- First term bounded with high probability by (uniform) consistency of detrending method

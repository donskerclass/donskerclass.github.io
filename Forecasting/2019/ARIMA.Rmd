## Probability Models and Hidden Variables 

- With additive and autoregressive models, series is sum of many fixed components and one residual or error term
    - $y_t=s(t)+h(t)+g(t)+\sum_{j=1}^{p}b_jy_{t-p}+\epsilon_t$
- Given past data $\mathcal{Y}_{t-1}$, all randomness in predicted distribution comes from $\epsilon_t$ 
- This is convenient for producing a predictor and writing down a likelihood
    - If $\epsilon_t\sim f(x)$, conditional likelihood of observation $t$ is $\ell(y_t|\mathcal{Y}_{t-1})=f(y_t-s(t)-h(t)-g(t)-\sum_{j=1}^{p}b_jy_{t-p})$
- Interpretation is that all predictive information is encoded in additive terms
- In principle, there can be *multiple* sources of variation in $y_t$ which are not seen
    - "Hidden", or **latent** variables, which may evolve over time, may affect $y_t$
- For forecasting, we don't care about the hidden variables themselves: don't need to figure out what they are
    - But they can create detectable patterns in the series we do care about
- Allowing for hidden variables can allow simple way to account for these patterns
    - But also create challenges due to indirect and complicated relationship between model and predictor
- The **Moving Average** (MA) Model is one of the most popular and useful hidden variables models    


## The Moving Average Model: Origin

- Russian economist Eugen Slutsky investigated how regular economic patterns could arise from pure randomness
    - He took a long string of random numbers from the lottery, and took the average of the first 10
    - Then he shifted the window over by 1, taking an average of the 2nd through 11th numbers
    - He repeated this through the full string, producing a sequence of overlapping averages, a **moving average**
- In this process, he produced a sequence that looked remarkably like the fluctuations observed in economic series
- He theorized that such a mechanism, where sequences of purely random shocks are combined to produce a single number, might describe the origins of economic cycles
- Today, *moving average* refers to a process generated by overlapping weighted combinations of random variables

## The Moving Average Model
    
- Consider a sequence of mean 0 uncorrelated **shocks** $e_t$ $t=1\ldots T$ which are *not* observed
    - $E[e_t]=0$, $E[e_te_{t-h}]=0$ for all t, for all $h\neq0$
- The observed data is still $\{y_t\}_{t=1}^T$
- The **Moving Average** Model (of order q) says that $y_t$ is a weighted sum of present and past shocks
    - For all $t$, $y_t=e_t+\sum_{j=1}^{q}\theta_{j}e_{t-j}$
- Coefficients $\theta=\{\theta_j\}_{j=1}^{q}$ determine relationship between observations over time  
- In lag polynomial notation, let $\theta(L)=1+\sum_{j=1}^{q}\theta_jL^j$, then $y_t=\theta(L)e_t$
- To produce a full likelihood, strengthen assumption to $e_t\overset{iid}{\sim}f()$, usually $N(0,\sigma_e^2)$
- Compare to the **Autoregression** model: $y_t$ is a weighted sum of a present shock and past *observations*
    - For all $t$, $y_t=e_t+\sum_{j=1}^{q}b_{j}y_{t-j}$
    - Lag polynomial representation $b(L)y_t=e_t$ has lags on the left side instead of the right
    
## Properties 

- The appeal of the MA model comes from the fact that although $e_t$ never directly seen, the properties of the data are characterized explicitly by the model
- In particular, the Autocovariance function is determined by parameters $\theta$
- $\gamma(h):=Cov(y_{t},y_{t-h})=Cov(e_t+\sum_{j=1}^{q}\theta_{j}e_{t-j},e_{t-h}+\sum_{j=1}^{q}\theta_{j}e_{t-j-h})$ $=\sigma_e^2\sum_{j=0}^{q}\sum_{k=0}^q\theta_{j}\theta_{k}\delta_{k=h+j}$
    - In words, covariances are determined by the moving average components shared between times
- Consider, e.g. MA(1), $y_t=e_t+\theta_1e_{t-1}$
    - $\gamma(0)=Var(y_t)=\sigma_e^2(1+\theta_1^2)$, $\gamma(1)=Cov(y_t,y_{t-1})=\sigma_e^2\theta_1$, $\gamma(j)=0$, for all $j\geq 2$
- Last property, that autocovariance function drops to 0 at $q+1$, is true for any $MA(q)$
    - Beyond the window of length q, the moving averages do not overlap, and observations are uncorrelated
- MA(q) model allows modeling short term correlations up to length $q$ horizon: predicted mean goes to 0 in finite time
- By allowing long enough $q$, can, with many coefficients, describe very general patterns of relationships
- As an MA model is linear, like AR model, does not allow for general patterns of higher-order properties like conditional variance, skewness etc 


## Challenge: Identifiability

- Difficulty of models with latent variables is that one cannot learn about the $e_t$ directly, but only their properties
- With two or more random components determining one observation, might not be able to distinguish which one was the source of any change
    - This is called an **identification** problem in econometrics
- Consider MA(1) processes $y_t=e_t+\frac{1}{2}e_{t-1}$, $e_t\overset{iid}{\sim}N(0,\sigma_{e}^2)$ and $y_t=u_t+2u_{t-1}$, $u_t\overset{iid}{\sim}N(0,\frac{\sigma_{e}^2}{4})$
- We see ACF of first is $\gamma(0)=\frac{5}{4}\sigma_e^2$, $\gamma(1)=\frac{\sigma_e^2}{2}$
    - ACF of second process is exactly the same, so by normality, distribution is also exactly the same
- This is an example of a general phenomenon: factorizing $\theta(L)=\Pi_{j=1}^{q}(1+t_jL)$ with inverse roots $t_j$, there is an equivalent representation $\tilde{\theta}(L)=\Pi_{j=1}^{q}(1+\frac{1}{t_j}L^j)$ with flipped roots and a different $\sigma^2_e$
- Does this make a difference? Not for forecasting: properties of series the same either way
    - Can simply restrict interest to a representation with all roots inside the unit circle, for Bayesian or statistical approach
- General lesson is that when building model out of unobserved parts, might not be able to learn all about them

## Relationship to Autoregression Model

- Properties of MA model can be seen by repeated substitution
    - Consider MA(1) $y_t=e_t+\theta_1e_{t-1}$ rearrange as $e_t=y_{t}-\theta_1e_{t-1}$
- Can substitute in past values $e_{t-1}$ into this formula repeatedly
    - $e_t=y_{t}-\theta_1(y_{t-1}-\theta_1e_{t-2})=y_{t}-\theta_1y_{t-1}+\theta^2_1e_{t-2}$
    - $=y_{t}-\theta_1y_{t-1}+\theta^2_1(y_{t-2}-\theta_1e_{t-3})=y_{t}-\theta_1y_{t-1}+\theta^2_1y_{t-2}-\theta^3_1e_{t-3}=\ldots$
- Continuing indefinitely, have, in lag polynomial notation, $(1-\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}(-\theta_1)^jL^j)y_t=e_t$
    - This is exactly an (infinite order) autoregression model
- This equivalence holds in general: a finite order MA model is an infinite order AR model
- Intuition: because $e_t$ never seen exactly, must use all past information in $\mathcal{Y}_t$ to predict it
- Observable implication: PACF will decay to 0 smoothly, rather than dropping off like AR
- Equivalence also holds in reverse: a finite order AR model is an infinite order MA model
    - Repeatedly substituting, AR(1) $y_t=b_1y_{t-1}+e_t$ becomes $y_t=e_t+\sum_{j=1}^{\infty}b^j_1e_{t-j}$
- Can use either, but one representation may be much less complex

## Estimation

- Because the shocks are not observed, likelihood formula for MA model surprisingly complicated
    - In general, no closed form formula exists for conditional likelihood
- Reason is that $y_t$ and $y_{t-1}$ both depend on $e_{t-1}$, but to know what part of $y_{t-1}$ comes from $e_{t-1}$ need to know what comes from $e_{t-2}$, which affects $y_{t-2}$ which requires... etc
- A variety of solutions exist which nevertheless allow valid estimates
- Likelihood can be constructed by *recursive* algorithm, step by step
    - Requires conditioning each period, which requires using Bayes rule, which requires integration
    - But if $e_t\sim N(0,\sigma_e^2)$, there is a fast and exact recursive algorithm
- Typical approach: use likelihood from normal case even if you don't think distribution is normal
    - This is called a **quasi-** or **pseudo-**likelihood, and $\theta$ can be estimated by maximizing it: this is default method in R in `arima` command
    - Or use penalized estimation, or do Bayesian inference with it
- Alternative 1: Choose parameters $\widehat{\theta}$ to match estimated ACF to model-implied ACF
    - Utilizes fact that only covariances are modeled by process, doesn't need normality
- Alternative 2: Convert to infinite AR form and estimate by least squares, truncating at some finite order
    - Not exact, but since decay usually exponential, truncated part is close to negligible and prediction becomes very easy: just use AR formulas

<!-- - Acts as way to get very high order AR, but with coefficients depending on small # of parameters -->

## Combinations: ARMA models

- To efficiently match all features of correlation patterns, can also use *both* AR and MA
- An Autoregressive Moving Average Model of Orders p and q or **ARMA(p,q)** model has form, for all t,
$$y_{t}=\sum_{j=1}^{p}b_jy_{t-j}+e_{t}+\sum_{k=1}^{q}\theta_{k}e_{t-k}$$
    - Where $e_t$ is still a mean 0 white noise sequence
- In lag polynomial notation $(1-\sum_{j=1}^{q}b_jL^j)y_t=(1+\sum_{j=1}^{q}\theta_jL^j)e_t$
- By same equivalency results, an ARMA model is equivalent to an infinite AR model or an infinite MA model
    - Can denote infinite MA representation as $y_t=\psi(L)e_t:=\frac{\theta(L)}{b(L)}e_t$
    - ARMA model allows finite representation for very general patterns
- Estimation again usually by normal (quasi-)likelihood, with recursive algorithm    
- In addition to invertibility condition for MA roots, have one more equivalency
    - If factorizations of $b(L)$ and $\theta(L)$ share a root, can factor out from both sides and get model with exact same predictions
    - Not a problem for prediction: just present in factorized form
    - Estimation can behave weirdly when roots are "close" (worse approximation, etc)

## ARIMA models

- Condition for stationarity or an ARMA model is that the AR part satisfy conditions for stationarity of AR model
    - All roots of lag polynomial $b(x)=(1-\sum_{j=1}^{q}b_jL^j)$ are outside the unit circle
- In the case of d unit roots, differencing $y_t$ d times can restore stationarity 
- If $\Delta^d y_t$ is an ARMA(p,q) process, $y_t$ is called an **ARIMA(p,d,q)** process
- ARIMA model allows long run random trend, plus very general short run patterns
- Exactly the same unit root tests as in AR case apply: run Phillips-Perron, KPSS, or ADF to determine d
- `auto.arima` executes following steps
    - Test $y_t$ for unit roots by KPSS test, differencing if found to be nonstationary, repeating until stationarity
    - Represent ARMA (quasi)likelihood by recursive algorithm at different orders $(p,q)$
    - Use AICc to choose orders, then estimate $b,\theta$ by maximizing (quasi)likelihood
- This takes statistical approach to prediction: looks for best model of data
    - Performs well for mean forecasting over models close to ARIMA class
- Bayesian approach requires priors over all AR and MA coefficients   
    - Often use infinite AR representation for simplicity: use priors to discipline large number of coefficients

## Seasonal Models

- Use ARIMA around around trend model to account for deterministic growth, seasonality, etc
- Can also extend model to add *non-deterministic* seasonal patterns
- For a series of frequency $m$, may have particular relationships across intervals of length $m$ or regular subsets
- Can create seasonal versions of ARIMA models by allowing relationships across $m$ lags
- Useful for modeling commonly seen spikes in ACF at seasonal intervals
    - Eg. strong December sales one year may be followed by strong December sales next year, on average 
- Seasonal AR(1) is $y_t=B_1y_{t-m}+e_t$, seasonal MA(1) is $y_t=e_t+\Theta_1e_{t-m}$, seasonal first difference is $y_t-y_{t-m}$
- Can combine and extnd to higher orders to create Seasonal ARIMA (P,D,Q) 
    - $(1-\sum_{j=1}^{P}B_jL^{mj})(1-L^m)^Dy_t=(1+\sum_{k=1}^{Q}\Theta_jL^{mj})e_t$
- Can add on top of standard ARIMA to match seasonal and cyclical patterns by multiplying lag polynomials
    - Seasonal ARIMA(p,d,q)(P,D,Q) takes form $(1-\sum_{n=1}^{p}b_nL^{n})(1-\sum_{j=1}^{P}B_jL^{mj})(1-L)^d(1-L^m)^Dy_t=(1+\sum_{k=1}^{q}\Theta_jL^{j})(1+\sum_{k=1}^{Q}\Theta_jL^{mj})e_t$
- Estimation similar to standard ARIMA: test for integration order, use quasi-maximum likelihood to fit coefficients
    - Seasonal components permitted by default in `auto.arima`: can exclude if series known to be deseasonalized

## Application Continued: Macroeconomic Forecasts

- Let's take the 7 series from last class forecasting exercise, following Litterman (1986)
    - GNP Growth, Inflation, Unemployment, M1 Money Stock, Private Fixed Investment, Commercial Paper Interest Rates, and Inventory Growth quarterly from 1971-2018
- Choose level of differencing using tests, then compare (by AICc) AR only, MA only, and ARMA choices for each series 
    - Implement by `auto.arima` with restrictions to AR order p or MA order q
- Series restricted to AR or MA only appear to need more parameters than if allowed to use both
    - Unrestricted model for inflation is ARIMA(0,1,1), but if forced to MA(0), select AR(4): need many AR coefficients to approximate MA property
    - Unemployment has reverse: choose ARIMA(2,0,0), but need MA(3) to match if AR order restricted to 0 
- Resulting forecasts of most series similar across specifications due to rapid mean reversion   
    - MA reverts to mean (or trend if series integrated or trending) in finite time, AR reverts over infinite time, but distance decays exponentially fast
    - Unemployment is only series where AR vs MA difference notable: slower mean reversion than other series

## The Multivariate Case

- Vector Autoregression (VAR), Vector Moving Average (VMA), and Vector ARMA (VARMA) models similar to 1 variable case, but with more coefficients
- Vector Autoregression much more commonly used than VMA or VARMA cases, so discuss only this
    - By equivalence relationships, can represent all as infinite order VAR 
- With $m$ variables, $y_t=(y_{1,t},\ldots,y_{m,t})\in\mathbb{R}^m$
- For all $t=p+1\ldots T$, $i=1\ldots m$, the VAR(p) model is
$y_{i,t}=b_{i,0}+\sum_{k=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{p}b_{i,jk}y_{k,t-j}+\epsilon_{k,t}$
- Where for all t, k, j, $h\neq0$, $E[\epsilon_{k,t}]=0$, $E[\epsilon_{k,t}\epsilon_{j,t+h}]=0$ 
- Collecting coefficients in matrices, can write as $y_t=B_0+\sum_{j=1}^{p}B_jy_{t-j}+\epsilon_t$
- Typical to assume $\epsilon_t\overset{iid}{\sim} N(0,\Sigma_\epsilon)$, where $\Sigma_\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}$ gives present covariance
- (log) Likelihood again takes (multivariate) normal form: weighted least squares
- Stationarity conditions analogous to m=1 case: roots (of particular polynomial) inside unit circle
    - `roots` in library `vars` can display
    
    
<!-- - To construct likelihood, need to also assume distribution for $\epsilon_t$ -->
<!--     - Most common is $\epsilon_t\overset{iid}{\sim}N(0,\sigma^2)$, $Pr(\epsilon<m)=\Phi(\frac{m}{\sigma})=\int_{-\infty}^{\frac{m}{\sigma}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp(\frac{-x^2}{2})dx$ -->
<!-- - Likelihood is $\Pi_{t=k+1}^{T}\frac{1}{\sigma}\phi(\frac{y_t-b_0-\sum_{j=1}^{p}b_jy_{t-j}}{\sigma})$ -->
<!-- - Log Likelihood is $-\frac{T}{2}\log2\pi\sigma^2+\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=k+1}^{T}(y_t-b_0-\sum_{j=1}^{p}b_jy_{t-j})^2$ -->
<!-- - Parameters $\theta=(\{b_j\}_{j=0}^{k},\sigma^2)\in \Theta\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{k+1}\times\mathbb{R}_{+}$ -->
<!-- - Interpretation: value today depends linearly on last $p$ periods, up to unpredictable noise -->
    
## Multivariate VAR Priors

- Can construct multivariate version of normal-gamma priors for VARs which is also conjugate
- Multivariate normal $N(\mu_B,\Sigma_B)$ prior on $B_j$, $j=1\ldots p$ with covariances $\Sigma_B$
    - With $m$ variables, $p$ lags, have $m(p+1)$ coefficients, so $(mp+m)^2$ prior parameters to choose just here
- **Inverse Wishart** distribution $W(\Psi,\nu)$ on $\Sigma_\epsilon$ multivariate version of Gamma distribution
    - $\Psi\in\mathcal{R}^{m\times m}$ is prior guess of $\Sigma_\epsilon$, $\nu\in\mathbb{R}$ sets concentration 
- Minnesota priors due to Doan, Litterman, Sims (1984), at FRB Minneapolis can help simplify choices
- Goal is to express typical properties of macroeconomic series for business cycle forecasting 
- Prior mean for $b_{i,1i}=1$, all other coefs 0 (equivalently, $B_1=I_m$ identity matrix) 
    - Each series centered on random walk in just itself, with lags and cross-equation effects 0
- Variances $\sigma^2_{\epsilon,i}$ $i=1\ldots m$ in $\Sigma_\epsilon$ estimated by sample variance of residuals from 1 dimensional AR(p)         
- All prior covariances across coefficients set to 0: independent normal guesses for each    
    - Variances are $\Sigma_{b_{i,jk}}=$ $H_1/h(j)$ for own lags $H_2\sigma^2_{\epsilon,i}/(h(j)\sigma^2_{\epsilon,k})$ for $i,jk$ coefficient, $H_3\sigma^2_{\epsilon,i}$ for constant
    - Parameters $H_1,H_2,H_3$ set tightness of prior around own lags, cross-variable effects, and constants, respectively
  
    <!-- - Each $b_{0,i}$ has own large variance, covariances 0 -->
    <!-- - Own lags $b_{i,ji}$ have prior variance $\frac{\sigma_1}{h(j)}$ -->
    <!--     - Set scale representing tightness, then variance decreases with lag order -->
    <!-- - Cross equation lags have prior variance $\frac{\sigma_2}{h(j)}$ -->
    <!--     - Set scale representing possible cross-variable effects, then variance decreases with lag order -->

    
## Application: Litterman (1986) Macroeconomic Forecasts

- Minnesota priors developed for macro forecasting applications at the Federal Reserve
    - Alternative to large, complicated and somewhat untrustworthy explicit economic models used at the time
    - Allows many variables to enter in unrestricted way, but minimizes oerfitting due to priors
- Litterman went on to be chief economist at Goldman Sachs, and method spread to private sector
- Example from Litterman (1986): BVAR with Minnesota priors over 7 variables from before 
- 6 lags in each variable, with a constant
- Choose prior parameters $H_1=1$, $H_2=0.2$, $H_3=1$, $h(j)=j^{-2}$
    - Noting that scale is proportional to variance estimates, says expect constant to deviate by 1 standard deviation of series
    - Own first lag deviates from 1 by about standard deviation of series, later lags have variance decaying harmonically
    - Cross-equation effects expected to vary 20% as much as own-lag effects from 0
- Implement using `bvarm` function in [BMR library](https://www.kthohr.com/bmr.html) for Bayesian VARs and related models used in macroeconomics  
- Forecasts and corresponding intervals appear reasonable despite that some series (M1, Investment) are clearly trending

#Convert to a data frame

#Set up Minnesota-prior BVAR object, and sample from posterior by MCMC
# See https://www.kthohr.com/bmr_docs_vars_bvarm.html for syntax documentation: manual is out of date

#Warning: command is incredibly slow if plot=TRUE is on, fast otherwise
# Appears to be issue with plotting code in BMR package, which slows down plotting to visualize
# With too many lags and series, have to wait through hundreds of forced pauses
```
```{r}
# ADD VAR and ARIMA forecasts to plot

## Interpretation

- Point forecasts differ somewhat, but within respective uncertainty intervals
    - Note: Bayesian predictive intervals are not confidence intervals and vice versa
    - Predictive intervals give best average-case prediction of distribution given data over the model
    - Confidence intervals construct region containing data 95% of the time, if model specification true
- BVAR uses longer lags, prior centered at unit root to account for persistent dynamics
    - Order of AR lags must be longer both to account for integration and for possibility of MA dynamics
    - Prior over higher lags reduces variability of estimates, reduces overfitting by regularization
- Test-based approach attempts to detect unit roots and difference them out, then find best stationary ARMA model
    - Model selection by AICc acts against overfitting, but leaves remaining coefficients unrestricted

## Conclusions

- Latent variable models like moving averages can be used to concisely describe data features
    - Since not seen, representations are not unique
    - AR and MA equivalent, but one may be much more efficient, taking finite rather than infinite order
- Latent models can be combined with models of observables like autoregressions (with or without integration) to extend descriptive capability
- Multivariate case results in many more parameters, especially if using high order VAR
    - But Bayesian approach allows imposing discipline using priors

## Motivation

- Resurgence of interest in ML in "learning from preferences/human feedback"
- *Extremely* brief overview of how preferences are modeled and estimated in empirical economics
    - With some connections to the ML methods
- Inspired less by Kahneman-Tversky Optimization than by this [joke thread](https://twitter.com/xuanalogue/status/1733155253967565195) on the name

## Preferences

- What are they?
    - Given a set of options $X$, preference relation is a partial order $\preceq$ over elements of $X$
    - Denote $a\succeq b$ "a is preferred to b" for any $a,b\in X$ 
        - $a\succ b$ "a is strictly preferred to b" if $a\succeq b$ and not $b\succeq a$
    - "Rationality"
        - Complete: $\forall a,b\in X$, $a\succeq b$ or $b\succeq a$
        - Transitive $\forall a,b,c\in X$, $a\succeq b$ and $b\succeq c$ $\implies$ $a\succeq c$

- How to represent them
    - Utility/reward functions $u():X\to\mathbb{R}$: equivalent to rational preference relations
        - $u(x)\geq u(y)$ iff $x\succeq y$
    - Defined up to scale: strictly monotone transform $g(u(.))$ represents same relation
    
- Rational behavior
    - Given choice set $X_c\subseteq X$, choose $x^* \in \arg\max_{x\in X_c} u(x)$


## Data to learn preferences

- Given choice sets $\{X_c\subseteq X:c\in C\}$, use stated or revealed preferences
    - Revealed: Observe $(X_c,x^*(X_c))_{c\in C}$ choices when presented with set of options
    - Stated: Ask for rank ordering, top-k, numerical ratings, or proxy 

- Feedback carries assumptions about representability:
    - Revealed preference: if choices follow preferences, no need to ask for feedback
    - Numerical feedback: if preferences genuinely ordinal, scale is meaningless.
        - Even assuming rationality, obtain $f(u(.))$ for some non-unique $f$
        - Explains why it's sometimes claimed numbers are hard to get from people
    - Ranking feedback
        - Completely defines preference relation
        - Less informative than numerics if scale $u$ actually exists
    - Partial ranking (eg compare 2): aggregates up to full ranking *if* rationality holds
        - Revealed preference is special case: top 1
    

## Real data does not satisfy axioms

- At least 3 reasons
    - Noise: people make mistakes or are uncertain
    - "Irrationality": preferences may be defined but not satisfy all axioms
    - Heterogeneity/aggregation: groups of people probably don't have same preferences
    
- Problems these induce
    - Usual problem of noiseless model: no perfect data match
    - Cycling: $A\succeq B\succeq C \succeq A$ with at least one strict
    - Equivalence of representations breaks down!
    
##  Step 1: Noise: *Random Utility Model*

- Replace $u(x_j)$ with $u(x_j)+\zeta_j$, $\zeta\sim P(\zeta)$
- $x^*=\arg\max_j\{u(x_j)+\zeta_j\}$ induces $P(x^*=x_j)$ (Conditional) Choice probability (CCP)
- (Multinomial) Logit model, or **Plackett-Luce** (1960) choice model
    - $\zeta_j\overset{iid}{\sim}\text{Gumbel}\implies P(x^*=x_k)=\frac{exp(u(x_k))}{\sum_j exp(u(x_k))}$
    - Alternate derivations: maximum entropy among all multinomial distributions, Luce axioms directly over choice probabilities
    - Special property: *Independence of irrelevant alternatives*
        - $Pr(a|\{a,b\})/Pr(b|\{a,b\})=Pr(a|\{a,b,c\})/Pr(b|\{a,b,c\})$
            - Relative probs unaffected by choice set
        - Good: Can perform *rank-breaking*: all info is in binary comparisons
        - Bad: "Red bus/blue bus" problem: introduce $c$ which is identical to $b$ except superficially (ie $u(b)=u(c)$, $P(a\cup b)$ goes down, $Pr(b \cup c)$ goes up
- Many many alternatives: Probit ($\zeta_j\overset{iid}{\sim}N(0,1)$), correlation structures, mixtures, etc        
        
## Step 2: Heterogeneity

- Aggregation of rational preferences studied in **Social Choice Theory**
    - Voting rule: map $\{\succ_i\}_{i=1}^{N}\to \{\succ\}$
- Example rules:
    - (sequential) Majority vote: pair off choices $a,b$, discard b if $\sum_{i} 1\{a\succ_i b\}>\frac{1}{2}$
    - Dictatorship: use person j's preferences
- Famous results
    - Condorcet: Majority vote outcome depends on order: $\exists$ distributions of rational preferences such that preference defined by majority winner is not transitive
    - Arrow's theorem: there exists no well-defined voting rule which satisfies all of 
        - Not-dictatorial
        - Unanimity respecting: if $a\succeq_i b\ \forall i$ and $a\succ_i b$ for some $i$,  $a\succ b$
        - Independence of irrelevant alternatives: if $\succ_i$-ordering of $a,b$ unchanged $\forall i$, $\succ$-ordering also unchanged 
        
## Irrationality

- In reality, anybody can choose anything for any reason: we have absolute human freedom
    - Engineering dictum: if it is physically possible to enter an input, no matter how dumb, we will see it in our system
- Makes deciding whether we *want* to make model consistent with choices hard
- Usual argument: *Reflective equilibrium*: make choices that match *well-considered* choices that people would defend if explained back to them
- Practical implementations
    - Use RUM, declare $\zeta$ to be mistaken or irrational, optimize $u$
    - "Multiple self": take choice as result of voting model over mixture of preferences, extract and optimize the right one
        - Feasible if marked by, e.g., time: I procrastinate because my bad choices are a problem for future me, not present me
- Many open questions        

## Aside: risk and uncertainty

- Whole setup assumes people choosing actually get the option they choose
- If outcomes vary, eg due to system unreliability, people face uncertainty
- Bernoulli-von Neumann Morganstern-Savage: Theory of choice over *lotteries*
    - Offer a *probability distribution* $\pi$ over choices
- Representation: *expected* utility maximization: max $\sum_j \pi_j u(x_j)$
    - $\exists$ axiomatic formulation due to Savage
    - Can recover cardinal utility $u$ from choices due to linearity of expectations
- Behavioral theories: 
    - Kahneman Tversky: prospect theory: max $\sum_j w(\pi_j)u(x_j)$
    - Generalization: arbitrary functions of lottery vector [Peterson et al (2021)](https://mayank-agrawal.com/papers/PetersonBourginAgrawalReichmanGriffiths21.pdf) 
- Ambiguity: $\pi$ not given
    - Savage: (hierarchical Bayes): collapses to EU 
    - Ellsberg, Aumann, Choquet, Gilboa, etc: minimax 
    
## Taking risk into account 

- No LLM training experiments I know of measure or express preferences over distributions of outputs
    - Instead optimize over *realizations*
    - Could be done: assess random samples of completions
        - "Do you prefer 100% reliably mediocre outputs or 90% great, 10% bad"
    - Might do something for reliability tuning
- But standard LLMs do *optimize* a noisy output generator
    - Using ERM implicitly assumes that we care about *expected* reward optimization
    - Subclass of vNM EU preferences
    
        
## Step 3: Heterogeneity + Noise

- Actual choice data will give samples of rankings over any choice set due to some mix of both 
- With $K$ options, look at fraction of times each ranking $\Pi$ over $\ell$ choices observed
- $\ell=2$ case: "Duels"
    - $K\times K$ symmetric $Q$ matrix of win proportions $Q_{i,j}=P(i\succ j)$
- $\ell>2$ case: "Battles"
    - For each K choose $\ell$, menu, count proportion of each ranking over $\ell$ choices
    - "Rank breaking": collapse this down to binary win rates 
- Model approach: fit RUM to this data
    - Account for heterogeneity with observable contexts/covariates
    - If misspecified, obtain model in class closest in KL divergence to observed choice distribution
- Mixture models: each ranking is sample from one of several preference orderings
    - Can be distribution of noiseless orderings, or mixture of RUMs
    - Popular example: mixed multinomial logit

## Aggregation rules for random outcomes

- To acknowledge heterogeneity, take rank matrix and apply voting rule
    - Per Arrow, no best such rule    
- Condorcet: break into binary comparisons $Q_{ij}$, winner is majority vote
    - Global winner *only* exists if no cycles
- Copeland: rank by $d_i = \{\#k| q_{i,k}>\frac{1}{2}\}$ number of bilateral wins
- Borda: rank by $q_i=\frac{1}{K-1}\sum_{k\neq i} q_{i,k}$ average bilateral margin
- Random walk (pagerank): rank by max eigenvector of $Q$ matrix
- von Neumann: Define 0-sum game where $i$ played against $j$ has payoff $2q_{ij}-1$
    - Nash equilibrium is distribution $\pi$ over options that maximizes expected payoff played against itself 
     
## What is RLHF doing

- Goal is optimizing $p(x^\prime|x,\theta)$ to optimize a preference model
    - Data are contexts, randomly sampled completions, and stated preferences $(x, x_a^\prime,x_b^\prime, 1\{a\succ b\})$
    - Fit PL (=logit) model to preference data, then choose $\theta$ to optimize expected reward by PPO (clipped reweighted gradient ascent)
- Direct preference optimization: DPO: same objective, but apply trick I learned as the [Hotz-Miller (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2298122) inversion
    - In dynamic random utility model, difference in log CCPs determines difference in value functions
    - One step: choose $\theta$ to optimize log CCP difference
- Problems: preference from many annotators given some rules (prefer "helpful, harmless, honest" etc) may not follow PL model
    - Solution: find alternative models and win concepts
- Methods optimizing alternative concepts
    - [Zephyr](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16944) finds Copeland winner
    - [Self-play preference optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04056) Swamy et al: finds von Neumann/Minimax winner
    - Distributional preference optimization: fit mixture model: need additional rule to turn into "winner"
    - RL with AI feedback: use LLM as noisy preference proxy...
    
## Implications: data collection

- We have the option to choose what kinds of data obtained
    - Ranking vs binary comparison vs numerical scores
- Preference models tell us what is learnable with each type and how fast
- How fast is matter for learning theory
    - Active learning, (dueling/battling) bandits, etc
    - Generalizes sorting algorithms to noisy setting
    - Assumed preference model determines feasibility, complexity
    - Results known for many but not all settings; esp Plackett Luce

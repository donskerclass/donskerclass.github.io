      <description>This has been another year where I felt like I slacked on my reading, and that probably is genuinely true for the tumultuous last half, but my read folder lists 154, so I can pick out a few that I liked to highlight in this end-of-year tradition. These are in approximate chronological order by date read, and as always I make no claim to depth or representativeness, so even in areas I follow there’s a lot on my should-read list.</description>

      <description>I felt like I barely did any serious reading this year, and maybe that’s even true, but my read folder contains 168 papers for 2023, so even subtracting the ones that are in there by mistake, that’s enough to pick a few highlights. As usual, I hesitate to call these favorites, but I learned something from them. They are in no particular order except chronological by when I read them.</description>
